Do you get indigestion when a business you know has to close up because they were hit by a cyber incident? Do you just keep your head in the sand and hope the bad guys don&rsquo;t even know about your very small hobby-turned-business store?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Feeling afraid or ignoring reality is not a way to keep your business alive.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There is a war. And your business is in the cross-fires and once in a while, will become the target. You might not ever see the bullet or the enemy but they are there and it is only a matter of time before you are noticed.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Maybe your margins are too slim though. You see the Googles of the world with teams of thousands whose entire purpose is to keep the rest of Google secure. These people seem like they know their stuff and so that means lots of money. You see tools. So many apps. Each one with a price tag. And maybe you could afford one but which one and how do you even use it? You got bracelets to make! It&rsquo;s the holidays for Pete&rsquo;s sake!</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Well, this article is here to let you know what the bare minimum is. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A backup strategy, </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That&rsquo;s it.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Every Cyber protection plan will have lots of extras but ALL of them will talk about backup.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And Backup can be cheap. It DOES require you to be committed though.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first thing is to ask yourself: What is the data I absolutely can not lose? </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This will change from business to business. But if you are into healthcare this will be patient data. If you have any kind of personal information on customers and their credit information, this too. Data used for auditing or revenue purposes. Yup!! Don&rsquo;t try to include ALL the data you own. Just what you need to survive and what is legally required.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Next, you need to get some kind of backup device. Probably the easiest is Google Drive or something similar. All the data that goes in there is encrypted which is what I was going to suggest doing next. But, if you don&rsquo;t like the cloud then you can buy an external hard drive. You will have to figure out a way to encrypt the data, such as using password protection on doc or excel files and perhaps an app like BitLocker for Windows and FireVault for Mac.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The last thing and arguably the hardest is you need to come up with a schedule for backing up and STICK TO IT. This means every Friday at 9 pm before you close your shop or do that thing you need to send your data to the cloud or plug in your external hard drive and &ldquo;DO THE BACKUP&rdquo;. It could be helpful to have an alarm set on your phone to remind you. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt to have some ritual in place as well. Maybe a fun drink or cool tunes while you are doing it. Then, once you are done, place that hard drive somewhere safe and you can feel good that you have a set of data that is important and safe.</span><a href="../index.html">Back</a></p></body></html>
