The first one was to have a backup of your critical data. You know, the stuff that you need in order to keep doing business. The second one was to make sure you had only the bare minimum of software running on your computers in order to run your business. AND you had to make sure that all that software was patched and up to date. This even applies to your home, by the way. To make your life easier, you should delete all the applications you don&rsquo;t need/use and then always say yes when asked to update the rest.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The fact that you are considering priority 3 is a good thing. It could be fun. Could be&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">This is training yourself and your staff around phishing. What is it? There are lots of other names for the technique but the basics is when a bad person tries to influence you and your employees to do something they shouldn&rsquo;t do. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">You might not feel comfortable doing the training yourself but fortunately there are a lot of online resources to help you. I have made some suggestions below. I would suggest that after you watch and read them that you spend an hour talking with your employees about what they learned. Perhaps go through your email, especially your SPAM folder and look for all the attempts to get you to do some action like click a link. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">I would then chat about what you would do if someone on the team accidentally fell for the scam. Be reassuring and inform them that no blame would happen. Tell them that they would not lose their job but it is very important for everyone to share that that happened. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">If it does happen, you might notice your computers slowing down or some advertising appear on your desktop. The worst is that your computer is locked down by a ransomware gang or that some software is placed on your computer to begin to act like an admin user. If you suspect that this is happening and you have no IT person handy, the best bet is to wipe what you think is the infected computer, reinstall everything and use your backup to bring your important data back online. I would even suggest practicing this during a slow time so that you know exactly how to do it.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Remember to reassure everyone that they did the right thing even though you might be thinking otherwise. This will ensure that employees speak up and this allows you to detect the problem ahead of time.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6">Resources:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DD_yAYhjNE-0&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1701908483950254&amp;usg=AOvVaw36iKL4RFE9VB2VNm3GQhwH">Security Awareness Episode 4: Phishing and Ransomware - YouTube</a></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DHc01oZPvByg&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1701908483950641&amp;usg=AOvVaw3Kp1CKWRO-dxfDxQ4Xvtqf">Security Awareness Episode 6: Vishing - YouTube</a></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D5tmcp5fpb18&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1701908483950865&amp;usg=AOvVaw3RJuoENA6LA87GIHhJ1g4B">Social Engineering Webinar - YouTube</a></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2"><a class="c0" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DwKiT0ulhNFs%26t%3D42s&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1701908483951079&amp;usg=AOvVaw14Zgf3RRkr5uvcvu9E_cuh">Security Awareness Training: Incident Reporting - YouTube</a></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span><a href="../index.html">Back</a></p></body></html>
